This project consists of conducting an in depth analysis upon CTD data obtained from the OOI website. Consisting of 7 different data parameters, I obtained the data via the OOI database for a total of 24hours for winter and summer. Different days are chosen throughout the 7 differing data parameters as some CTD data sets don't have data on similar days. For winter, I tried to stay within the late December to early January range, while for summer, mostly staying within the late June or early July. The Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler data is not included in this report as it specifically only includes a near 4 to 8 hours of data. 
# Comparing Dives (Shallow vs Deep)
Comparing dives for the deep and shallow profilers (shown below), within 24 hours, shallow profilers will have 9 dives within a day; while deep dives will have 2 dives.

Note: OSBDP winter, then OSBDP summer respectively. Winter data no matter the timeframe will not express a days worth of data. 

# Maximum SSP
In terms of maximum ssp, the maximum ssp occurs when dives are generally deeper. 
Comparing maximum speed of sounds, for deep and shallow parameters, they are 1499 m/s to 1497 m/s respectively. The speed of sound profile is higher in the summer as well, because as the temperature of water increases, sound waves travel faster in water.
Displayed below are the average ssp profiles for all 14 scenarios:

(Some of the same days are unobtainable. Years may differ but range is generally within the same week of late November or mid December)

It is relevant that the speed of sound is faster in the ocean at as well at the surface of the water. In relevancy to day and night, there is not a large speed of sound change. Compared to other data, the speed of sound is very similar within 1499 m/s in deep waters.
