This project consists of conducting an in depth analysis upon CTD data obtained from the OOI website. Consisting of 7 different data parameters, I obtained the data via the OOI database for a total of 24 hours for winter and summer. Different days are chosen throughout the 7 differing data parameters as some CTD data sets don't have data on similar days. For winter, I tried to stay within the late December to early January range, while for summer, mostly staying within the late June or early July. The Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler data is not included in this report as it specifically only includes a near 4 to 8 hours of data. 
# Comparing Dives (Shallow vs Deep)
Comparing dives for the deep and shallow profilers (shown below), within 24 hours, shallow profilers will have 9 dives within a day; while deep dives will have 2 dives.
